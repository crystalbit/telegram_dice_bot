# telegram_dice_bot

Hi!

This is an example of a telegram bot getting dice result and giving a custom reply.

Stack:
- typescript
- telegraf.js

Some type casts had to be done. First because telegraf.js has outdated type Dice for now (someone should do a pull request there, may be me), another because it is late evening :)

The bot is deployed at https://t.me/dice_x_bot
